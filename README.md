genome
======
This module provides functionality to create, modify, and otherwise
manage genomes for evolutionary programming.
Simple commands constitute genes, sequences of such genes form a
genome.

The goal is to make several genomes compete in a given environment
(against each other or against a fitness function) and make the
fittest individuals breed while the weakest die. Running this process
over many generations would hopefully see the genome pool evolve to
fitter individuals.
